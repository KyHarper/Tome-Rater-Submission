The goal of this repository is to bring together the concepts I've learned over my Codecademy Pro Intensive class. 
As such, it's been built to reflect the requirements found in TomeRater Instruction.pdf.

This version of TomeRater includes the "price" variable and analysis tools for my optional features choice.

To run this program, ensure both files are in the same folder and run "Populate.py." The populate file may also be edited to provide your own sample input
